        <h4>Case 1</h4>
        <p>M: A friend from church has a little girl with Down syndrome, and she was one year younger than I am now when she had her. I remember her telling me about how shocked she was when they told her within minutes of delivering that they thought she had Down syndrome. Her daughter is such a sweet, lovely, little girl, but it was very difficult on my friend and her family in the beginning. And I know I would love my child regardless if she had Down syndrome, but I just worry that I won’t be here forever, and who will take care of her after I’m gone? So maybe it isn’t fair to bring a child into this world that can’t take care of herself...</p>

        <p>Click one of the following statements/questions below to continue the conversation with M:</p>

        <ol>
          <li class="answer" onclick="showGuidance(this)"><p>It sounds like you are somewhat familiar with Down syndrome. Is your friend from church the only exposure to Down syndrome you have had or have you met an adult with Down syndrome?</p>
          <div class="guidance"><p><em>Guidance:</em> <span class="excellent">Excellent.</span> You are asking open-ended questions to determine M’s knowledge of Down syndrome so that you can learn about the fears she may have about raising a child with Down syndrome and can correct potential misunderstandings she may have.</p></div></li>

          <li class="answer" onclick="showGuidance(this)"><p>I hear that you are concerned about the wellbeing of your child, but let’s first talk about what your chances of Down syndrome are based on your age.</p>
          <div class="guidance"><p><em>Guidance:</em> It is good to validate the concerns of your patient, but you have redirected the conversation from M’s concerns to information-giving. It is helpful to obtain more information from M or continue to inquire about M’s needs after providing her an age-related risk assessment.</p></div></li>

          <li class="answer" onclick="showGuidance(this)"><p>It sounds like your friend had a difficult time with the initial diagnosis. Did your friend’s experience of finding out her baby has Down syndrome after birth make you realize that you would want to know before delivery if your baby has a genetic condition?</p>
          <div class="guidance"><p><em>Guidance:</em> <span class="excellent">Excellent.</span> You have validated M’s concerns and asked her a follow-up question to learn more about whether she would be interested in prenatal testing.</p></div></li>
        </ol>
