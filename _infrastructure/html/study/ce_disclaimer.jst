    <h1>Patient-Centered Genetic Counseling</h1>

    <h5>Agenda</h5>
    <p>The participant will have the opportunity to engage in a professional development exercise focusing on clinical decision making in the prenatal setting. The module will use both hypothetical clinical prenatal cases and an educational component introducing the principles of patient-centered counseling and shared decision-making.</p>

    <h5>Needs Assessment</h5>
    <p>All health care providers (and students who will become providers) bring personal experience into the exam room. These experiences can sometimes make it difficult to apply patient-centered genetic counseling techniques in prenatal clinics. Even though there is a best counseling strategy, there is no instrument to determine the specific relationship between personal experiences and the genetic counseling recommendations by current providers. There is currently also a lack of training/curriculum offered to students (future health care professionals). This program aims to provide participants with the tools needed to follow best practices in patient-centered counseling.</p>

    <h5>Learning Objectives</h5>
    <p>After completing this online activity, learners will be able to:
      <ol>
        <li>Identify personal implicit biases towards individuals with physical and/or intellectual disability.</li>
        <li>Illustrate principles of patient-centered counseling.</li>
        <li>Apply patient-centered counseling approaches to cases involving patients with disabilities in order to promote patient-centered care.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h5>Target Audience</h5>
    <p>The target audience is physicians, genetic counselors, other health care providers, faculty and students who are interested in counseling prenatal clinical genetic disorders. Health care providers need not specialize in genetics to benefit from this program.</p>
